# Jamming - The Spotify Search Tool

This application is a Spotify music search tool that allows users search fo music on Spotify, create a playlist from their search results, which they are able to save to their Spotify account. This means a user would need to have a Spotify account inorder to use this application. 


# How I worked on this project

I decided to work on this project because I wanted to give myself a little bit of a challenge. This project is part of the Codecademy Full Stack Enginner Course. It is a react project and it was originally written as a class based component project. A huge part of this project was refactoring the entire code from class based components to function based components. 
By doing this, I was able to have a better understanding of the differences between class based components and function based components and the ways React hooks in function based components make thing easier when it comes to managing state.


# What I learned from this project

Aside from getting a better understanding on React Hooks, this project was also a great way for me to understand how to work with external APIs on a react project and how react projects use APIs.


 # How I can improve this project

 There is no perfect project and there are a few things I feel I could add to improve the project.
 1. I could add a loading feature on the buttons to notify the user when the queries are taking place. Currently, there is no way for the user to know whether this happens and in some cases, it may seem like the application is broken.
 2. I could also add a feature that allows the user listen to a small snippet of the music in the search results. This helps with a better user experience because the user can make a decision as to whether they want to add the song to their playlist or not by simply listening to the playback feature.
 3. I could also learn more about deploying projects that contain .env files as this was a major challenge during this project and prevented the project from being deployed.
